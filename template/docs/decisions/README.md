# Decisions

This directory contains decision records.

For new ADRs, please use [adr-template.md](adr-template.md) as basis. It is
intentionally kept minimal, if you want to add more details, then follow the
pick from the full template at <https://adr.github.io/madr/#full-template>.

More information on MADR is available at <https://adr.github.io/madr/>.

General information about architectural decision records is available at
<https://adr.github.io/>.

## Immutability

ADRs are immutable after acceptance. Do not edit the substance of an accepted ADR.

When a decision changes, create a new ADR and mark the old one as
"Superseded by ADR-NNNN". This preserves the decision-making history.
